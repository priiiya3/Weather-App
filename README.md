### Installing Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary packages required for the project:

```
npm install
```

### Starting the Application
To start the app in development mode, execute:

```
npm start
```

This command runs the app, and you can view it in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000. The app will automatically reload if you make edits, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.

For more information on running tests, refer to the documentation specific to your project's testing setup.

## Technologies Used
React: Utilized for its efficient, declarative, and flexible JavaScript library capabilities in building user interfaces.

Axios: Employed for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from the Tomorrow.io API, known for its ease of use and promise-based architecture.

Tailwind CSS: Chosen for styling the application, providing a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

React Router DOM: Used for handling routing within the application, enabling navigation between different components without refreshing the page.

## Issues and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
Server Busy: This error might occur due to high traffic on the weather data server, leading to delays or failures in data retrieval.

## Solutions
### Retry Later: Attempt to fetch the weather data again later when the server might be less busy.
### Contact Support: If the issue persists, contacting the support team of the weather API for further assistance is advisable.
